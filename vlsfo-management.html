						<p class="excert"><strong>From a point of view of loss prevention, 
						we have taken into account practical issues already being 
						experienced in the management of low Sulphur fuel, and the 
						organizations experiences based on cases that have already 
						occurred in the short period since the implementation of 
						the IMO 2020 Fuel Oil Sulphur cap (Since 2020 Jan).</strong>
						</p>
						<p>Irrespective of the objectives intended to be achieved 
						through the implementation of the IMO 2020 Sulphur Cap, 
						there is no denying that this has caused considerable issues 
						arising out of potential contractual responsibilities and 
						liabilities in respect of compliance, between the Ship-owners 
						and its charterers.</p>
						<p>It is quite clear that there are two principal methods 
						of compliance with Sulphur Cap – the use of compliant fuel, 
						eg LSFO with a Sulphur content which does not exceed 0.50% 
						m/m, or alternative technology using high sulfur fuel (with 
						a Sulphur cap of 3.5%. This high Sulphur fuel will have 
						to employ an exhaust gas cleaning system (EGCS), commonly 
						known as a scrubber. </p>
						<p>Having said that there are still “grey” areas and considerations 
						on the impact of the low Sulphur cap especially in view 
						of either existing or future charter parties, with special 
						reference to those that were in force prior and will be 
						carried over post low Sulphur cap compliance date. <br>
						In the context of the concerns about the impact of new (untested) 
						blends and hybrid compliant fuels on the vessel&#39;s main engine, 
						it is still unclear whether the charterers would be directly 
						responsible if the vessel suffers engine damage, and this 
						is many times construed as a “comfort blanket” by the owners.
						<br>
						In a recent case handled by Constellation Marine Services 
						Engineer surveyors, it was found that owners had put the 
						blame on the vessels extensive engine damage, loss of time 
						and slow steaming squarely on the charterers supplied VLSFO.
						<br>
						This was particularly tricky in view that both the parcels 
						of VLSO supplied to the vessel were seen compliant in all 
						aspects when tested. It was thus left to our attending surveyor 
						to carry out a factual and technical enquiry into whether 
						the vessel&#39;s main engine (including her fuel system) was 
						in a satisfactory state to receive, store and burn the fuel 
						in the first place. <br>
						Notwithstanding the outcome of this investigation, it is 
						important to highlight that even despite best efforts by 
						fuel manufacturers and suppliers, technical problems brought 
						about by certain characteristics of the new fuel oil are 
						likely to be more frequent and more far reaching. <br>
						It is therefore of utmost importance for ship owners (and 
						to an extent charterers) to be able to identify the concerns 
						associated with VLSFO and have technical capabilities of 
						the vessels Fuel management systems verified prior to the 
						use of this fuel. (Most engine manufacturers have instructions 
						in place for ships engineers to follow). </p>
						<p>The below is intended to serve as an aid memoire extracted 
						from our technical experience in investigating fuel management 
						issues that have occurred so far:</p>
						<div class="feature-img" align="center">
							<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/blog/VLSFO2.jpg" alt="Fuel Oil Sulphur VLSFO Management">
						</div><br>
						<p><strong>PURIFIERS</strong></p>
						<p>Purifiers are an important defense against contaminated 
						fuel It is therefore thought prudent to consider evaluating 
						the condition of the onboard purifiers more thoroughly through 
						inspection by the maker or its authorized dealer. <br>
						The use of portable cat fine testers may be worth evaluating 
						since this will assist the ship crew in keeping a closer 
						eye on this parameter in addition to purifier samples normally 
						tested in the laboratory. Installation of an in-line monitoring 
						system for cat fines may be another option worth exploring.
						<br>
						With the changes in the type of fuel use, the importance 
						of record keeping is of paramount. Importance factors, related 
						to the purifier operational condition such as fuel specific 
						density and the size of the gravity disc used, set time 
						of sludge discharge, the flow rate, inlet temperature, etc. 
						may help prove that the purifiers were operated properly.
						</p>
						<p><strong>FILTERING EQUIPMENT</strong></p>
						<p>Strainers, filters and other similar equipment fitted 
						as a part of a fuel treatment installation on board may 
						require extra attention in case of stability or compatibility 
						issues. The use of a 10 μm filter elements serving auxiliary 
						engines as well as the main engines should be considered. 
						Installation of a finer than standard 10 μm filter mesh 
						may be considered after consultation with engine maker.
						</p>
						<p><strong>ENGINES</strong></p>
						<p>It is widely accepted that engine performance and power 
						output depend on a number of fuel qualities such as energy 
						content, ignition quality and combustion properties. <br>
						While the quality of fuel and its properties cannot be changed 
						by on board treatment, crew should nevertheless observe 
						closely and record any adverse effect on engine operation, 
						e.g. knocking, increased smoke emission, starting problems, 
						unstable shaft revolutions and etc. <br>
						Lubricity of low Sulphur fuel has been identified as another 
						possible issue. Sulphur is stated to be one of the elements 
						that contribute to fuel lubricity, lack of which in VLSFO 
						and VLSFO may lead to premature wear of the rubbing components. 
						Therefore, greater emphasis and frequency of used lube oil 
						testing should be performed to provide an early indication 
						of mechanical wear. </p>
						<div class="feature-img" align="center">
							<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/blog/VLSFO1.jpg" alt="Fuel Oil Sulphur VLSFO Management">
						</div><br>
						<p><strong>FUEL SULPHUR CONTENT ISSUES</strong></p>
						<p>Taking on board fuel that later exceeds the requirements 
						of the IMO Sulphur cap poses greater issues, not only in 
						its management but also port state fines especially within 
						Northern Europe coastal states and USA. <br>
						Therefore, it is worth considering purchase of a portable 
						fuel Sulphur content analyzer in order to be able to quickly 
						check Sulphur content prior to the bunkering. </p>
						<p><strong>TANK AND SLUDGE PRODUCTION</strong></p>
						<p>Since IMO 2020 compliant fuel contains considerably less 
						Sulphur than residual fuels, it can easily be contaminated 
						if it is bunkered into tanks where there are remnants of 
						high Sulphur fuel.</p>
						<p>Apart from this issue, loading low Sulphur fuel into 
						uncleaned tanks may also cause technical difficulties, and 
						as per IMO MEPC.1/Circ.878., If such fuels are loaded into 
						HSFO fuel tanks that have not been cleaned, there is a possibility 
						that they could dissolve and dislodge sediments and asphaltic 
						sludge in storage tanks, settling tanks and pipelines, potentially 
						leading to purifier and filter operational issues and in 
						extreme cases fuel starvation resulting in loss of power.
						<br>
						Thus In order to avoid accidental non-compliance and machinery 
						problems it is advisable to clean bunker tanks and settling 
						service tank from settled and adhering layers of old fuel.
						<br>
						It should be noted that regardless of the tank cleaning 
						method, fuel piping and other elements of relevant systems, 
						such as fuel filters and fuel heat exchangers, will inevitably 
						have to be flushed with compliant fuel for several days 
						in order to ensure full compliance. <br>
						In the case of manual cleaning it may be useful in engaging 
						an external surveyor to verify cleanliness. <br>
						Contrary to common perception, given that there is an increased 
						likelihood of incompatibility and instability of fuels compliant 
						with IMO 2020 Sulphur Cap, an increased sludge production 
						has to be considered as an aspect of normal vessel’s normal 
						operation. <br>
						Fuel tanks may require more frequent bottom draining, additional 
						purification cycles and purifier sludge discharge at shorter 
						intervals will unavoidably translate into greater amount 
						of overall sludge generated. <br>
						The importance of documenting all aspects of tank cleaning 
						process cannot be overemphasized; logs and other documentary 
						evidence may be required to protect ship owner’s position 
						in case of any dispute related to fuel Sulphur content and 
						preparation for implementation of new regulation. </p>
						<p><strong>ENFORCEMENT</strong></p>
						<p>Broadly speaking the signatory countries to MARPOL Annex 
						VI are free to decide how they enforce the regulation and 
						how non-compliance will be penalized. <br>
						This is tricky, since how non-compliance is dealt with will 
						be wholly dependent on the jurisdiction. The usual methods 
						include vessel detention (with the threat of banning orders 
						for repeat offenders) and financial penalties. The level 
						of financial penalty is likely to vary significantly across 
						the globe and may escalate with repeated violations. </p>
						<p>It should also be borne in mind that traditional fuel 
						sampling methods must now be in compliance with the new 
						2019 Guidelines for on board sampling for the verification 
						of the Sulphur content of the fuel oil used on board ships 
						(MEPC.1/Circ.864/Rev.1). In essence there will now be 3 
						samples to consider:</p>
						<p>• The MARPOL delivered sample taken at time of bunkering 
						(recommended to be drawn from the receiving vessel’s manifold).
						<br>
						• The in-use sample which is drawn as close as possible 
						to the engine inlet. <br>
						• The not in-use onboard sample which is representative 
						of the contents of a vessel’s storage tank. </p>
						<p>In this case, we have seen instances where the in-use 
						sample was drawn from the bottom of a filter pot or a dead 
						leg in the system. It is questionable how representative 
						these samples are of the fuel in use and this practice should 
						be avoided.</p>
						<p>It is also understood that for enforcement requirements, 
						guidelines for drawing representative samples for the actual 
						fuel in use has yet to be developed by the IMO. Ship owners 
						are advised to be prepared to challenge Port state control 
						officers if they feel the sampling method adopted for enforcement 
						isn’t representative of the fuel in use.</p>
						<p>However it is of paramount importance that documentation 
						relating to VLSFO be recorded and maintained to the highest 
						level; if the Port state control officers have “clear grounds” 
						to escalate to a more detailed enforcement inspection, they 
						are then most likely to carry out in-depth documentation 
						checks, maintenance verification and fuel sampling/analysis, 
						as well as assessing crew familiarity with the system and 
						equipment.</p>
