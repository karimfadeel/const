					<h2>Sulphur Emission with respect to Marpol Annex VI – Expert 
					comment</h2>
					<div class="feature-img" align="center">
						<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/blog/quality-standards.jpg" alt="Sulphur Emission with respect to Marpol Annex VI ">
					</div>
					<div class="blog_details">
						<p class="excert">The forthcoming changes to the rules governing 
						Sulphur emissions in MARPOL Annex VI present tricky technical 
						challenges to interested parties. We believe no other regulations 
						in recent history of shipping has invoked the multitude 
						of responses than the Sulphur 2020 cap. </p>
						<p>Being unprecedented in nature, numerous meetings, conferences, 
						programs and discussions have been held, many papers and 
						articles propagated on this subject. <br>
						Constellation Marine services, in addition to being the 
						regions premiere Marine Survey Company, puts great emphasis 
						on consultancy too, and to that end, our organization has 
						had the good fortune of being represented in various forum 
						discussions, and we work closely with regulatory bodies 
						to decipher the requirements behind this forthcoming change. 
						It is, thus, with some degree of certainty, we state that 
						the challenges introduced by the global Sulphur cap are 
						not exclusively technical. Very little though has been discussed 
						on its potential impact on contracts and charter parties. 
						Although the new global Sulphur cap will not arrive until 
						2020, (now not too far away) forward planning now could 
						help to avoid painful charter party disputes in the future. 
						In our assimilation of various discussions Constellation 
						marine have participated in, we firmly believe Time charter 
						parties may require close attention, with more challenges 
						anticipated for vessels already in long-term charter parties 
						that are likely to go beyond the enforcement date of 1 January 
						2020. For the benefit of our clients, Constellation Marine 
						services has assimilated the below narrative with a perception 
						that this may be useful for our clients that enter into 
						marine contracts and charter parties prior to and post enforcement 
						of the Sulphur cap regulations. Based on our understanding 
						there is no one “Magic Charter party” that would deal with 
						all of the issues that may arise. However, there is no denying 
						that most bunker clauses will require review, not to mention 
						other clauses, entirely dependent on the chosen method of 
						compliance. For vessels in existing charter parties and 
						to be redelivered post 1st January 2020, the below may be 
						a few points to consider: • What will be done, and at whose 
						cost, with any non-compliant fuel on board that can no longer 
						be used or is not allowed to remain on board? A prohibition 
						on the carriage of non-compliant fuels will come into force 
						on 1 March 2020 for vessels not fitted with scrubbers. Non-compliant 
						fuels will have to be removed to avoid fines or the vessel 
						being detained. If non-compliant fuel is not consumed before 
						1 January 2020, who will be obliged to arrange or pay for 
						the removal of such fuel will depend upon the wording of 
						the charter party. The parties may wish to agree in the 
						charter party that non-compliant fuel will be used before 
						01/01/2020 to avoid extensive discharge costs and to maximize 
						bunker tank capacity for compliant fuels, could be an option. 
						• What is the definition of ‘high Sulphur’ and low Sulphur’? 
						– This is a tricky one At the moment, vessels burn either 
						‘low Sulphur’ (0.1%S max) fuel in ECAs or ‘high Sulphur’ 
						(3.5%S max) fuel outside ECAs. In 2020, there will be three 
						Sulphur types (&lt;0.1%S, &lt;0.5%S and &gt;0.5%S). This raises the 
						question: what will ‘low Sulphur’ and ‘high Sulphur’ mean 
						in 2020? The meaning of such terms we understand may have 
						a significant impact on bunkers on redelivery calculations. 
						• If scrubbers are being considered, who will pay for the 
						installation and any associated delay or deviation? Will 
						the vessel need to go to dry dock to fit scrubbers and will 
						this be allowed under the charter party? It is seen unlikely 
						that existing charter parties will expressly say who is 
						to pay for a vessel to have a scrubber installed. It is 
						only if the charterer is likely to benefit in fuel cost 
						savings then there may be scope for a commercial agreement 
						as to who will pay. At this moment the cost differential 
						is up for argument. • Can Owners be compelled to fit scrubbers? 
						Precedence has shown that the Courts have found that the 
						owners were in breach of certain clauses in the particular 
						charter parties for not having carried out the necessary 
						modifications to comply with changes to MARPOL Annex I. 
						But, the absence of scrubber on a vessel will not necessarily 
						put the vessel or its owner in breach of MARPOL Annex VI 
						or impact on the vessel’s documentation. (Reference Elli 
						and the Frixos [2008] 2 Lloyd’s Rep. 11) In conclusion, 
						where long term charter parties are already being in force, 
						there is less scope for planning ahead. However, it might 
						be possible to agree amendments to the charter party following 
						commercial discussions and consultancy, if needed about 
						how some or all of the issues will be dealt with. Where 
						charter parties are entered into after 01/01/20, the issues 
						to consider will we believe depend upon the chosen method 
						for compliance: • Exhaust gas cleaning systems (scrubbers) 
						The biggest debate we have observed here is – who will be 
						responsible for waste effluent removal? Depending on the 
						type of scrubbers used, effluent removal is necessary, either 
						to sea or to a reception facility. It is imperative that 
						who will be responsible for scrubber waste disposal will 
						depend upon the wording of the charter party. For owners 
						choosing open loop scrubbers, peculiar problems arise whether 
						a particular port / territorial waters permit them to discharge 
						effluents – posing another set of problems. • Will a higher 
						daily hire rate be justified? In the present scenario, forecasts 
						indicate HSFO (suitable for use with scrubbers) will be 
						around USD 250/- to USD 300/- cheaper than distillates. 
						Therefore it was seen argued that charterers may benefit 
						financially from the installation of scrubbers, but industry 
						pundits imagine this will lead to higher charter party rates 
						for vessels fitted with scrubbers. • Will performance warranties 
						be affected by the power demands of scrubbers? There is 
						an unprecedented need to review performance clauses, in 
						view that at this moment, the percentage of ships fitted 
						with scrubbers is low to merit any viable performance data 
						being validated. • Will the fuel prices agreed in the charter 
						party need to be changed? Owners choosing blends, distillates 
						and hybrids as the methodology for compliance have often 
						remarked on who would be responsible for the cost and time 
						of any bunker tank cleaning required due to switching between 
						certain fuels? Will the bunker quality clause need to be 
						amended, particularly given that some hybrid fuels do not 
						fit comfortably into ISO8217, is posing a significant challenge 
						to this method of compliance. Another often discussed aspect 
						posing a challenge – Will suitable and compliant fuel be 
						available during the vessel’s chosen trade? If not, who 
						will be responsible for any additional expenses, fines etc.? 
						Will the trading clauses need to be varied in view of any 
						known (or non-compliant) fuel availability issues on the 
						vessel’s chosen trade? We have also observed that similar 
						challenges will prevail if emerging fuels (LNG) are to be 
						used, and may also apply to existing long-term charter parties 
						It has thus been observed that that charter parties that 
						extend into 2020 may not clearly allocate responsibility 
						between the ship-owner and the charterer for ensuring that 
						their ships – and the bunkers they have on board – are compliant 
						with the new rules. Thinking ahead starting now may be one 
						option, in addition to any consultancy or expert assistance 
						they clients may require, where Constellation Marine services 
						are well placed to offer. </p>
