					<h2>Tanker Loading – OFF SPEC Cargo <br>
					(Benefit for Ship Owner and/or Underwriter)</h2>
					<div class="feature-img" align="center">
						<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/blog/tanker.jpg" alt="Tanker Loading – OFF SPEC Cargo (Benefit for Ship Owner and/or Underwriter)">
					</div>
					<div class="blog_details">
						<p class="excert">A 99K DWT tanker vessel was presented 
						for inspection upon completion of its first foot loading 
						of a cargo of gasoline</p>
						<p>Joint sampling conducted by Shippers and charterers surveyors, 
						and subsequent testing, showed the cargo loaded to be Off 
						specs. The parameter that failed testing was the Flash point 
						of the Gasoil The loading terminal FOTT thereafter cast 
						of the vessel and asked her to shift to anchorage with this 
						part cargo. The vessel shifted to anchorage, pursuant to 
						which the vessels owners IG P&amp;I club requested us to attend.
						</p>
						<p><strong>WHAT WE DID</strong> <br>
						We initially boarded the vessel at anchorage and sampled 
						all the loaded tanks <br>
						We attended the lab for testing of these samples together 
						with other interests. <br>
						At that time, we discovered, post testing that Gasoil in 
						all the nominated tanks 1P, 1S, 4P, 4S, Slop P, Slop S was 
						Off Specification as the minimum flash point requirement 
						was 60 degree Celsius. <br>
						We thereafter requested sampling and testing of the shore 
						tank from where the nominated cargo originated. <br>
						Together with the charterer’s representative, we sampled 
						the shore tank <br>
						The shore tank sample was jointly tested for flash point, 
						and it was observed passed, with the flash point very close 
						to the minimum required - 61°C vs minimum required 60°C
						<br>
						This presented a piacular problem for the owners, since 
						the supplier cargo was in specs… </p>
						<p>We then conducted, together with the owners, a theoretical 
						calculation for volumetric dilution of flash point. <br>
						The theoretical calculations resulted in cargo being in 
						specs, and the owners, in their eagerness to continue the 
						loading asked the vessel to re-tender NOR for further loading.
						<br>
						We remained cautious of these theoretical calculations, 
						and urged the owners through the P&amp;I club, as a safety net, 
						to have a blend sample prepared between the first foot sample 
						(4.16% by volume) with the shore tan sample (95.84% by volume) 
						and have it laboratory tested. <br>
						Indeed, this sample failed the minimum flash point requirement 
						(result 58.5°C vs minimum required 60°C) <br>
						We thereafter started our investigation into a cause consideration. 
						Given that the vessel would NOT achieve the required flash 
						point for the cargo when fully loaded, a decision was taken 
						to discharge the full parcel of the first foot cargo at 
						VOPAK terminal. This discharge was achieved without incident.
						</p>
						<p>The vessel thereafter re-arrived the FOTT terminal, and 
						was presented for loading after the initial first foot Off-spec 
						cargo was transferred to Tank # Slop P and was discharged 
						at Vopak Terminal, Fujairah. <br>
						The vessel thereafter was lined up to load and loaded three 
						(3) parcels of Gas Oil in a comingled condition as equally 
						distributed by volume in all her nominated tanks. The cargo 
						was loaded from 2 separate terminals. </p>
						<p>We continuously attended the vessel during the loading 
						operation, and as pre agreed internally drew the following 
						samples during the loading progress <br>
						• Manifold samples at the time of commencement of loading
						<br>
						• First foot samples from each cargo tanks # 1P/S, 4P/S 
						&amp; Slop P/S <br>
						• Composite cargo tank samples after completion of 40% of 
						cargo by volume <br>
						• Composite cargo tank samples after completion of 80% of 
						cargo by volume <br>
						• Composite cargo tank samples after completion of loading 
						of nominated quantity </p>
						<p>The above samples were tested, and each resulted in flash 
						point being barely above the minimum required 60°C, with 
						the 4(P)-sample testing only 59°C. <br>
						We again became suspicious and in order to ascertain the 
						reason behind this low flash point readings post testing, 
						we insisted on sampling the cargo from the Port facility 
						distribution line. <br>
						We found out that DL No. 5 and DL No. 7 were being used 
						to feed the vessel its cargo the second time. Both DL samples 
						were tested, and indeed, DL 5 sample resulted with reading 
						of 51.5°C and DL 7 with 60°C <br>
						We immediately alerted the Port Terminal Manager of this, 
						and after an operational discussion we had, it was decided 
						that further loading would continue only with DL 7 line.
						<br>
						We thereafter met the shipper’s representative and had a 
						dialogue with him, and ultimately convinced him to isolate 
						the DL5 from the Matrix manifold. </p>
						<p>The Port facility thereafter carried out line pushing 
						for DL 5, pursuant to which we again tested the sample from 
						DL5, and results obtained were 61.5°C <br>
						The loading thereafter continued till completion, with the 
						final parcel sampled upon completion was tested to find 
						the cargo fully in specs. </p>
						<p>OUR VALUE ADDITION <br>
						We ensured what is commonly know as good practice – Had 
						we relied solely on the results of the theoretical calculation 
						of volumetric dilution, and not insisted to corroborate 
						the results by a lab test of a bled sample by volume, it 
						was certain that during the initial loading, the vessel 
						would have ended up with a full load cargo being off spec 
						– the monitory consequences thus in comparison with discharge 
						of fist foot cargo versus full cargo would have been disastrous.
						<br>
						We did not sit back as mute observers assuming all would 
						go well during the second loading. We continued to sample, 
						test and monitor, and consequently were able to identify 
						the issues related to off spec cargo within DL 5, quickly, 
						and prevent further issues. <br>
						We took tangible action to protect our customers interests 
						– not only did we identify the DL 5 issue during the second 
						loading, but we also liaised with operation owners (terminal 
						and supplier) insure prevention of further loss by convincing 
						them to isolate DL 5 from the matrix manifold </p>
						<p>We also investigated the initial issues with contamination, 
						and found a likely leaking manifold cross over valve, the 
						possibility of vapor phase contamination, in view that vessel 
						was initially also loaded with MOGAS in the remaining tanks.</p>
